Problem 32 https://projecteuler.net/problem=32

We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use
of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example,
 the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254,
containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product
 identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way
so be sure to only include it once in your sum.
